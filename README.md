# Miscellaneous pytorch utilities, served as jupyter notebooks 

You can use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to render these notebooks, since github is failing to render these.
Unfortunately, nbviewer won't show you the interactive widgets of the notebooks, so you
will probably want to open them in your own jupyter instance.
